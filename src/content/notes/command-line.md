## I want to...

### Move or rename a file or folder

`mv PATH/TO/CURRENT-FILE-OR-FOLDER-NAME PATH/TO/NEW-DESIRED-LOCATION-OR-NAME`

### Copy a local file to a remote location

`rsync -avz path/to/local-filename hostname:/path/to/remote/directory/`

### Jump to the beginning or end of the command line

CRTL + A = jump to beginning
CRTL + E = jump to the end

### Look up a command in my history and run it

CMD + R = start search
Type to search, then hit enter to run command
