## I want to...

### Save my local changes to the remote repo

**Steps:**

1. `git add .` to stage all files to commit, or `git add <FILEPATH>` to stage specific files
2. `git commit -m "MESSAGE HERE` to commit the staged files with a message
3. `git push` to push the committed files to the remote repo

**Note:** at any point you can use `git status` to see what files are tracked/untracked by git and staged/unstaged

### See all branches

Local branches: `git branch`
Local + remote: `git branch -a`

### Create a new local branch that tracks a remote branch and then checkout the new local branch

`git checkout -b <new-branch-name> origin/<new-branch-name>`

### Checkout a pull request on a new local branch

`gh pr checkout <PR#>`

### Save changes for later without committing them

Stash all changes: `git stash`
Stash specific files: `git stash push <FILEPATH>`

- **Use case:** You are working on branch A and want to make changes to branch B without creating a commit on branch A or transferring your work-in-progress over to branch B. (Creating a commit might not be desirable because your unfinished work will then be a checkpoint instead of a work in progress). Git stash saves the changes on branch A locally without making a commit. You can then recover the stashed changes when you're ready to continue working on branch A.

### Retrieve stashed changes

`git stash pop`

**Note:** If you used `git stash` or `git stash push <FILEPATH>` more than once, you will need to pop each stash back in turn

### See what changes exist on an unstaged file compared to the last commit

`git diff <FILEPATH>`

### Create a new GitHub repo from local code

**Steps:**

**Part 1 - Initialize a Git repository to track your code**

1. In the terminal, `cd` to the root directory of the project
2. `git init` to intialize a Git repo from the local directory. By default, the initial branch is called `main`
3. `git add .` and `git commit -m "initial commit"` to commit your files to the local git repo.

**Part 2 - Add the local Git repository to GitHub**

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.com
2. GitHub will then give you some instructions that look like the below - copy and paste them into the terminal:
   `git remote add origin <URL TO REPO>`
   `git branch`
   `git push -u origin main`

### Configure the user name and email for your commits

The use case I had for this is wanting to have one GitHub account, but commit to personal projects from my personal email associated with the account and commit to my work projects from my work email associated with the account.

**For a single repo:**
Navigate to the repo in the terminal, then use these commands:
`git config --local user.name "Your GH user name"`
`git config --local user.email "Email associated with your GH account"`

**For all repos on a user account on your machine:**
Note - will be overridden by repo-specific (local) git config settings
`git config --gloabl user.name "Your GH user name"`
`git config --global user.email "Email associated with your GH account"`

**To check settings for a repo:**
Navigate to the repo in the terminal, then use these commands:
`git config user.name`
`git config user.email`
